LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell HDMI_CONTROLLER_BD_i/hdmi_tx_0/inst/encr/oserdes_m_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) HDMI_CONTROLLER_BD_i/hdmi_tx_0/inst/encb/cnt_reg[1]/CLR, HDMI_CONTROLLER_BD_i/hdmi_tx_0/inst/encb/cnt_reg[2]/CLR, HDMI_CONTROLLER_BD_i/hdmi_tx_0/inst/encb/cnt_reg[3]/CLR, HDMI_CONTROLLER_BD_i/hdmi_tx_0/inst/encb/cnt_reg[4]/CLR, HDMI_CONTROLLER_BD_i/hdmi_tx_0/inst/encb/dout_reg[0]/CLR, HDMI_CONTROLLER_BD_i/hdmi_tx_0/inst/encb/dout_reg[1]/CLR, HDMI_CONTROLLER_BD_i/hdmi_tx_0/inst/encb/dout_reg[2]/CLR, HDMI_CONTROLLER_BD_i/hdmi_tx_0/inst/encb/dout_reg[3]/CLR, HDMI_CONTROLLER_BD_i/hdmi_tx_0/inst/encb/dout_reg[4]/CLR, HDMI_CONTROLLER_BD_i/hdmi_tx_0/inst/encb/dout_reg[5]/CLR, HDMI_CONTROLLER_BD_i/hdmi_tx_0/inst/encb/dout_reg[6]/CLR, HDMI_CONTROLLER_BD_i/hdmi_tx_0/inst/encb/dout_reg[7]/CLR, HDMI_CONTROLLER_BD_i/hdmi_tx_0/inst/encb/dout_reg[8]/CLR, HDMI_CONTROLLER_BD_i/hdmi_tx_0/inst/encb/dout_reg[9]/CLR, HDMI_CONTROLLER_BD_i/hdmi_tx_0/inst/encg/cnt_reg[1]/CLR (the first 15 of 42 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_HDMI_CONTROLLER_BD_clk_wiz_0_0 and clk_out1_HDMI_CONTROLLER_BD_clk_wiz_0_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_HDMI_CONTROLLER_BD_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_HDMI_CONTROLLER_BD_clk_wiz_0_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_HDMI_CONTROLLER_BD_clk_wiz_0_0_1 and clk_out1_HDMI_CONTROLLER_BD_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_HDMI_CONTROLLER_BD_clk_wiz_0_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_HDMI_CONTROLLER_BD_clk_wiz_0_0]
